<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Clicking on one of the sections litsed in the navbar will navigate to the selected page. While on the page the section's name in the navbar will appear in bold.

The about section contains an image of me and some text describing me.
> Note: The text in the about section is currently only filler text and a more adequate description will be added later.

The portfolio section contains a grid of cards which will contain the names of my different projects and a brief description of them. While moving your mouse around the cards a glow effect will appear around the cursor while over a card and will more faintly carry over to the other cards. Clicking on a card will open up a modal containing some more information about the project including links to the deployed project and/or the project's GitHub repo. Clicking anywhere on the page while the modal is open will close it.
> Note: Most of the projects on there are placeholder and will be more replaced with offical projects once it is ready.

The contact section contains a form which asks for a name, email and message. The form can't be submitted when any of the fields are blank or an invalid email address is put in.

The reume section contains an embeded pdf of my resume as well as a link to a view and download it.
